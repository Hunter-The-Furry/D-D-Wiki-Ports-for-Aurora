            <h1>Summary</h1>
            <p>Anthrolupes are a race of anthropomorphic wolves who generally travel in packs.</p>
            <h1>Physical Description</h1>
            <p>Anthrolupes are similar to humans in shape and size but tend to have leaner builds and appear as anthropomorphic wolves. They are covered in thick fur that varies in color depending on the region they come from (e.g. those who are from forest regions may have black or brown fur while those from colder climates may have white fur). Anthrolupes also have sharp teeth and claws as well as pointed ears on top of their heads and a tail extending from the base of their tail bones. Due to their appearance, less sophisticated than other races like the wolffolk, they are often thought to be werewolves. Due to their unsettling appearance, they are often discriminated heavily against, often being hunted down as monsters</p>
            <h1>History</h1>
            <p>Anthrolupes have been around for centuries. Not much else is known about the origins of this race. Some think that their appearance was a curse while others believe they are a result of crossbreeding between different races. </p>
            <h1>Society</h1>
            <p>Anthrolupes have very honour-based societies. They tend to live in close-knit clans, termed "packs", and are rarely seen living in cities and towns. They care deeply for those from the same pack, often even willing to give their own lives in defence of friend or kin. However, an Anthrolupe that has lost its tail is seen as a disgrace. An anthrolupe's tail is seen as a badge of honour, and to lose it is devastating. Sometimes, criminals are punished by the removal of their tails. There are certain situations in which the loss of one's tail is seen as acceptable, such as in the defence of his pack. In Anthrolupe society, it is primarily the males that travel abroad, though females may travel for other reasons. </p>
